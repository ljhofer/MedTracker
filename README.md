## Description
I have created an application that helps users track their medications and then they take them. A user can create an account, add medications to their profile, and log when they take their medications. They can change their dosage and frequency of their medication or remove it from their list when they are no longer taking it. The app allows for the special admin privileges of searching all the medications the database and adding a new one.
